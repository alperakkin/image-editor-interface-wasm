[x] select new layer automatically
[x] add tooltips to buttons
[x] create an action system
[x] add action inputs to single events like grayscale (maybe a checkbox can be added)

[x] reset select action options
[] add drawing in canvas
[] add text
[] save edited image
[] move opacity filter in layercontainer to adjust opacity
[] re-calculate histogram after apply
[] refactor cropping method (implementin crop images without a crop canvas)
[] add selection (rectangular, circular, mouse path)
[] add filters to selection
[] zoom
[] flip image
[] fix aspect ratio of original picture on preview mode
[] design ui
[] add blending to layers
[] action inputs ui design (sliders & checkboxes ...etc)
[] set histogram data into selected layer also display histogram data from layer cache
[] create an alert if user tries to put an image on main layer
[] refactor pan image (use a lerp function to minimize over moves)
[] listen enter key for the modals
