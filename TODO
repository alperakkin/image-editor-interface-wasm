[x] create an action system
[x] add action inputs to single events like grayscale (maybe a checkbox can be added)
[x] collect action stack (possibly keep layer.imageData in a stack) to undo actions
[x] execute filters & actions on related layer canvas
[] render image after each action (on main canvas)
[] undo implementation
[] match template
[] add drawing in canvas
[] add text
[] save edited image
[] move opacity filter in layercontainer to adjust opacity
[] re-calculate histogram after apply
[] refactor cropping method (implementin crop images without a crop canvas)
[] add selection (rectangular, circular, mouse path)
[] add filters to selection
[] zoom
[] pan
[] flip image
[] fix aspect ratio of original picture on preview mode
[] design ui
[] add blending to layers
[] action inputs ui design (sliders & checkboxes ...etc)
[] create an empty image to work on it
